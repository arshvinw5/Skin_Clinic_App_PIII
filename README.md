Case Study

Aurora Skin Care is a medium-scale, affordable private skin clinic situated in Colombo to provide dermatological services to out-patients who are unable to receive medical facilities from the expensive skin clinics. There are two dermatologists visiting the clinic and the available consultation dates and times are as follows:
•	Monday: 10:00am - 01:00pm
•	Wednesday: 02:00pm - 05:00pm
•	Friday: 04:00pm - 08:00pm
•	Saturday: 09:00am - 01:00pm
Note that one dermatologist requires a 15-minute session per patient, and the selection of the dermatologist is based on the patient's preferences.
The front desk operator is responsible for booking appointments for patients by scanning through doctors’ consultation schedules for the date(s) requested by a patient and then informing the patient of the available options. If the patient is satisfied with a specific appointment time, they can reserve the appointment for that date and time by paying a registration fee of LKR 500 and providing patient information such as NIC, name, email, and telephone number.
Once the patient has received the treatment, the final fee is calculated according to the treatment type. A 2.5% tax is added to the final amount, which is then rounded up to the nearest decimal number. The treatment types with fixed prices are listed below:

Treatment	Price
Acne Treatment	2750.00
Skin Whitening	7650.00
Mole Removal	3850.00
Laser Treatment	12 500.00
